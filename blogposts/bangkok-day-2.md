I started it off Day 2 in Bangkok with a tasty espresso at a coffee shop called Rolling Roasters. The interior design was clean and modern with a second story seating area overlooking the baristas down below. The baristas were looking hip and the music was on point, a true sign of a quality coffee shop.

Following this I packed up my things and checked out of my hotel. I had some time to kill before checking into my hostel up the street, so I went to a coffee shop that caught my eye yesterday called Fred Thonglor. I’m glad I tried this place. This is a great coffee / lunch spot to do some computer work at. You get a small, clean and modern shop with a great view of the hustle and bustle outside.

After an enjoyable 2 hours, it was on to my new accommodation for the next 8 nights. I checked in and instantly realized this would be a much different experience from the 4-star hotel I was just at. This 2-star hostel had about 3 brothels or strip clubs on the road leading up to the hostel. I’m going to be seeing a lot of these girls for the next week. Later in the evening, I traveled east to Bang Chak and Sukhumvit 95 to try some street food for the first time. I managed to get some Som Tam, or Thai papaya salad. It was sweet, crunchy and just spicy enough for me (good thing I went with the one chili). The best thing I had tonight was probably the skewered chicken on a stick.

It was nice and hot with a sweet, tangy coat of sauce. And to finish the night I had the famous ham and cheese croissant Toasty from 7-11. It did not disappoint. Japan may have onigiri rice balls, but these toasties give them a run for their money. I’m starting to appreciate the hustle culture out here in Bangkok. Whether it be running a street food shop out of their house or giving people lifts on their motorbikes, these Thai sure seem to enjoy working to earn some Baht.

Other notes:

Seems like public restrooms are rare except in shopping malls where you have to pay a small fee and in western style hotels. Not good for my sensitive tummy.

The BTS skytrain is a delightful way to zip around town.
