Feeling sick and worn down, I decided to take it easy today. The only new site I visited was the Ruam Sab Market. This is a local lunch spot open on the weekdays for nearby office employees and students. The prices are insanely low. I ate 3 meals for about 180 Baht, or about $5.

I attended my second Crossfit WOD here in Bangkok, again at Training Ground. They really have a great box here in Bangkok. Since I had an upset stomach, I ate McDonald's at the nearby food court in the shopping mall. The fried chicken wasn't as good this time. I guess getting freshly fried chicken is hit or miss.

Right before bed, I locked myself out of my private room as I went down to chill in the hostel lobby. Sadly, we had to wake up the Thai cleaning lady from her sleep and get her to unlock my door. I gave her 100 Baht for the trouble. Considering you can buy almost two full meals with a 100 Baht bill, I think this was a decent tip.

I don't have much left on my want-to-see list. Some temples, Chinatown, and the giant ICONSIAM mall. Should be able to knock those out before I leave. I just wish my irritated throat and tight, painful left hip would resolve themselves.
