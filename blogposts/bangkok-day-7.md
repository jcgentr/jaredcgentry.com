Today marks the first full week in Thailand and Mekong region. My watch says I've done 100,061 steps this week for an average of 14,294 steps daily. Not too bad. The day started off as usual these days, with a couple espressos and computer work at Bottomless coffee shop nearby. Feeling a different type of cuisine, I decided to travel over to Pahurat, or Bangkok's Little India. I ate at Tony's along the river. I had a samosa, mutton curry and some type of Paneer with peas. I washed it down with a sweet Thai tea. Overall, this meal was one of my favorites so far, but I'm a big fan of Indian food so no surprise really. The mutton curry got to my stomach, but thankfully the MRT station attendant helped direct me to a bathroom ðŸš½ in time ðŸ˜….

On the way back to the hostel I walked through Chinatown. I had to dip out early though because it was just too crowded for me. There were a lot of tasty looking street stands. Too bad I had just eaten. I may come back to Chinatown at night if I have time.

In the evening I went to Muscle Factory to get in a bodybuilder-style workout. This gym is a bit of walk to get to but worth it. This giant warehouse gym has all the equipment you'd need. Looking around I saw many juiced up muscle heads and attractive Thai women. This gym would be great to have in rotation if you lived here.

Following a sweaty workout, I traveled to Siam Square and MBK center. Siam Square was pleasantly lit and peaceful with its walkable streets and plaza devoid of any cars or motorbikes. MBK Center was massive. I tried to get to the food court before it closed at 10pm. Even at 9pm, all the shops were essentially closing up, so I had to venture outside and find a street food stand. I'm glad I did because I had a delicious shrimp Pad Thai and stir-fried pork and basil dish.

Other notes:

Food courts here seem to close 1 hour before the advertised closing time of 10pm. Should get there by 8pm to enjoy a meal.

I think I'm addicted to cow piss.

Make sure the change you receive is correct. I lost 500 Baht (~$14) after buying a 40 Baht train ticket with a 1000 Baht bill.
