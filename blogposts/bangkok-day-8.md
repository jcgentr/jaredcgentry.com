Another chill day was in store for today as I try to gear down before I leave Bangkok for Siem Reap. I would have visited the Grand Palace and Reclining Buddha, but I'm not waking up early enough to make it worth it. I may either wake up early tomorrow before I leave or wait until I return to Bangkok for a night in a few weeks.

Instead, I traveled across the river to the giant ICONSIAM mall. This mall has to be the best I've ever been in. It has 10 floors and 500,000 square meters of floor space. Inside is a bit overwhelming, especially in crowded areas like the food court. However, I braved the conditions and had a decent meal of meat sticks and shrimp fried rice in the food court. The food court is designed to resemble a street food market. There's even a small pond area that resembles a canal or something you'd see in Venice.

I ended up buying some Keen sandals upstairs. My feet have formed rashes from all the walking I've done in cheap flip flops. In the evening, I attended another Training Ground Crossfit class. On the way back to the hostel, I stopped by a Thai restaurant I always passed but never tried. I'm glad I did. I had an enjoyable and spicy meal consisting of crispy pork neck, papaya salad, and Tom Yum with shrimp and coconut milk. I also tried a Pandan drink. It was slightly sweet and tasted like roasted almonds.
