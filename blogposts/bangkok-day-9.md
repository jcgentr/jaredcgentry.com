Today, I increased my attack and defense points by attending a Muay Thai training class. I essentially had a private lesson since there were only two other guys in the class who had done Muay Thai before. I learned the basics like movement, jabs, kicks, and even a spinning elbow move. I quite enjoyed this class. Hitting the pads of the instructor as he called out the next move was like a testosterone-fueled game of Bop It.

For my late lunch, I went back to my favorite restaurant I've found here, Hom Duan. I got the Khao Soi again since it's irresistible. I knew this wouldn't end well for my stomach, but it's so damn good. The rest of the day I made sure to be close to a toilet as the Khao Soi ran through me.

Therefore, I had to skip Crossfit and do some computer work at a Starbucks instead. Well that's all for Bangkok (although I'll be back for a night or two before traveling to the Philippines). I really enjoyed Bangkok. It'll be hard to top this Asian megacity. Tomorrow I'm off to Siem Reap, Cambodia!
