I flew to Chiang Mai around 1 pm today. When checking out of the Luang Prabang hotel, the front desk lady (sweet Vietnamese lady) almost double charged me for the room. I'm glad I caught that. She might benefit from using excel or some accounting software instead of her graph paper notebook.

The flight was quick 1 hour hop from Laos to Thailand. Thankfully, I was able to move to the empty aisle seat on my row once the child behind me started kicking my assigned window seat.

Once I landed and passed through an easy immigration process, I got a Grab to the AirBnB. The self-check-in was a breeze. This apartment has a great 270&deg; view of Chiang Mai on the 8th floor. Alas, the bed is once again a spring mattress.

I ate a late lunch at Beast Burger (no affiliation with Mr. Beast that I know of) around the corner. It was the best burger I've had since arriving in SEA. The beast sauce was yummy. It's like a spicy mayo, but with a signature Thai chili flavor. I'll probably hit up this spot a couple more times before I leave. It's a bit expensive though.

For dinner, I found a poke bowl place around the corner as well. This was a really solid poke bowl. Obviously the fish wasn't the best I've had in a poke dish (I'm spoiled from poke in Maui ðŸ˜‹), but as a whole the bowl had great flavor.

On the way back to the BnB, I passed one of the best looking coffee shops I've ever seen. I'll have to try it tomorrow morning. Also, tomorrow morning, I might try to join a pickleball group I found on Facebook.
