I may have consumed too much ganja last night. I bought a cookie edible from the shop around the corner. After eating half the cookie and waiting an hour, I didn't feel much, so I ate the other half. This was a mistake. I was comfortably numb while I watching Seinfeld until 2 am.

This morning I woke up with a parched mouth and serious brain fog. This state continued for the most of the day. It finally lifted a bit around 5 pm. So, this is to say I didn't do much today. Mainly, I just worked on my dev projects.

I did try the cool looking coffee shop around the corner. They sell some expensive single origin beans that looked tasty, but I opted instead for a latte and Americano. I enjoyed the light roast used for the Americano and the glass used for the latte.

For lunch, I managed to find a khao soi restaurant up the street. Apparently, this shop has a Bib Gourmand distinction from the Michelin Guide (not quite a star). Both khao soi dishes I ate, the spicy pork sausage one and the green curry chicken one, were delicious. The curry had an excellent fatty, spicy, and savory flavor. I also really enjoyed the grass jelly juice I ordered as my drink.

For dinner, I ordered in a pepperoni pizza. Later, I found a gelato place and had a pistachio gelato cone. Walking around the Nimman area while eating the gelato was a nice, relaxing experience. The area dies down a bit on these side roads, and they become more walkable with a chill vibe.

Tomorrow, I'll get back on the horse.
