This morning started off much better than yesterday's. I rose before my alarm, grabbed an Americano, and headed to the pickleball courts. This pickleball group plays _every day_ of the week from 8am to 1pm. They even had paddles to rent. I played from about 11 am to 1:30 pm. Playing again since leaving the US 45 days ago felt so nice.

For lunch, I enjoyed black truffle roast beef ramen at a restaurant I noticed during yesterday's aimless walking. I was drawn in by its Japanese-style seating arrangement â€” a long wooden counter that provided a clear view into the kitchen (great for those dining solo). The bowl of ramen had plenty of that umami flavor, but I wish it had more roast beef.

In the evening, I attempted workout 24.3 of the Crossfit Open at Crossfit Chiang Mai. I didn't do so well at the workout, only getting to complete 1 bar muscle up. I'm evidently out of shape. I did enjoy the box, the atmosphere, and the people though. I even won one of the raffle prizes, which never happens for me. I'll definitely come back here for a few WODs.

For dinner, I tried a local Thai restaurant. I ate crispy pork belly and shrimp pad thai, neither of which was the best I've had since arriving in SEA, but the prices were reasonable.

Finishing the night, I got another gelato, this time blueberry cheesecake, and walked around the One Nimman area. One Nimman is a lovely, modern market. It had many different merchant shops around the perimeter selling clothes and crafts. In the middle of the inner plaza was a group of guys breakdancing.

The weekend's going to be _hot_ ðŸ¥µ, so maybe I'll look for some bodies of water to cool off in.
