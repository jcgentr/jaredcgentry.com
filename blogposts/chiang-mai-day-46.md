I started off the day a bit late since I couldn't stop watching the movie Snatch last night. It's such a good movie with fantastic pacing.

Morning coffee was another light roast Americano and latte from Roast8ry.

I decided to try the co-working space across the street from me today. I really dislike the chair and desk setup in this Airbnb. Something about the height and plastic chair really irritates my hip flexors. This co-working space has a reading room with computer chairs from which I worked on my fullstack todo app. Luckily, I received a free day pass in exchange for some data about me (nothing not already on the Internet).

For lunch, I ate at a nearby restaurant known for their roasted chicken with tamarind sauce. This was a very enjoyable lunch. The roasted chicken was juicy, and the tamarind sauce added a tasty sweet and sour flavor. All this with bites of sticky rice and a Thai tea to wash it down made for a great meal.

In the evening, I met up with my Thai pickleball comrade and played some pickleball with his group at a place that had both pickleball and padel courts. As the sun set, the sun glowed fiery red. It was pretty, although I wonder how much the pollution contributes to the color seen. I haven't seen the mountains outside my Airbnb since I got here. There seems to be a real air pollution problem here.

For dinner, I went back to Beast Burger and had a egg and cheese burger with fries and a side of beast sauce. Dessert was once again a gelato cone. I opted for tiramisu tonight. I think blueberry cheesecake has been the best flavor so far.

Tomorrow morning I'm leaving early to go bamboo rafting with my Thai pickleball pal and his friends. This should be a good way to cool off from this heat wave here.
