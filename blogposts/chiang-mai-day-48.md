I started today once again with some pickleball. I didn't play particularly well, but at least I got some exercise and sun in this morning. My friend Run and I kept losing to some old men. We nursed our wounds over some ramen for lunch. My ramen wasn't very good, but the fried gyoza was solid.

Running out of clean underwear, I knocked out a quick load of laundry at a coin laundry place around the block. This took about 1 hour and 100 baht, which was much faster than the 1 day duration for the laundry service at the Airbnb apartment complex. While waiting for the washing to finish, I ate a chicken sandwich at Beast Burger as my second lunch. I'll probably stick to the burgers here from now on.

In the evening, I went back to Crossfit Chiang Mai to attend a WOD. We did heavy front squats for the strength section and max burpee broad jumps for the conditioning part. My strength in the squat has definitely diminished since traveling. This was the first time I've done burpee broad jumps as a WOD, but it was kind of fun. My tibs are sore, though, I guess from the landing and quick deceleration.

After returning from Crossfit, I walked to the giant, modern Maya mall down the main street near my place. I ate Pad Krapow, Asian Chicken Wings, and Bua Loi at the fourth floor food court. Everything was delicious, especially the Pad Krapow. I might have to go back for it and tell them to give a double helping.

Tomorrow, I think I might take a break from all the exercise and go temple hopping.
