I didn't go on any excursions today, so this post will mainly be about the food I ate. I played pickleball in the morning. Run and I played some singles at the end. I ended up beating him both games we played but not by much. My competitive side really enjoys singles.

For lunch, I decided to eat a bit healthier than usual. I went to a spot called The Salad Concept. It seems to be mostly frequented by foreigners, since the prices are a bit more expensive than normal Northern Thai cuisine. I ate a Caesar salad and tuna sandwich. The Caesar salad was nicely tossed with a yummy Caesar dressing, and the bacon was better than most I've had over here. The tuna sandwich was a bit of a miss. It reminded me of a Subway tuna sandwich.

After attempting to deploy my todo app to Vercel, I attended another WOD at Crossfit Chiang Mai in the afternoon. I'm not sure if this week is a transition period for them following the conclusion of the Open, but these WODs are strange. The WOD today was basically a bodybuilding split of push and pull supersets. The sunset today was nice, though. The rain from last night helped clear away some of the smog, and the mountains nearby uncovered themselves.

For dinner, I went back to the nice Thai cafe around the corner, where I had a good bowl of Tom Yum a couple days ago. This time I went with the spicy papaya salad, pad krapow (no fried egg though), and red curry shrimp (or prawns?), washed down with a sour tamarind tea. Everything was really tasty. I can see why this place has great reviews. I think I enjoyed the red curry shrimp the most. The curry was spicy and savory and added great flavor to the shrimp. I also like that they include the heads of the shrimp / prawns, since it adds a bit of crunch and fattiness to the meal.

For dessert, I finally tried the toast place that I keep passing by when I go for my 7-11 runs. This place seems to always be packed with locals late at night. I had the buttered toast with strawberry jam and a nice cold milk. The toast was delicious. It's like something I'd make myself back home. And I appreciate a business that normalizes the drinking of whole milk for adults.

Tomorrow, I'm thinking about heading out to the Sticky Waterfalls. I'm not sure whether to save money and rent a bike to get there, or stay on the safe side and take an expensive Grab.
