I'm falling behind on these blogs, so the next few may be shorter than usual. After waking up sore, I decided to skip pickleball this morning. Instead, I did the same routine as Tuesday.

After deploying my todo app to Vercel and noticing significant API performance issues with the PostgreSQL database and / or Prisma ORM, I switched to SQLite with Prisma and deployed to Fly.io. This seemed to fix the performance issues. API response times went from 2 - 3 seconds down to 80 - 150 milliseconds.

After the deployment success, I decided to check out Bua Tong Sticky Waterfalls before it closed at 5 pm. The Grab ride took about an hour and was entirely too expensive, but I didn't have time to find an alternative, nor did I have an international license to rent a motorbike. Walking up the sticky waterfalls was a lot of fun. My feet truly stuck to the limestone rock underneath the flowing water. However, there were plenty of slick spots to slip and bust your ass on.

The walk up took about 10 - 15 minutes. There wasn't much else to the park, since most of the nature trails were under construction. It did have al fresco urinals, though.

Following the long Grab ride back into town, I ate an expensive yet delicious dinner of pork Panang and papaya salad. The salad was one of the best I've had. The julienne papaya had the perfect texture. The pork Panang had a tasty spicy and nutty curry sauce.

Tomorrow, I'll play pickleball for the last time before leaving Chiang Mai.
