I haven't been spending enough time working on my coding project called Eavesdrop, so I'll be keeping the next couple of blog posts short.

Today, I traveled domestically from Ho Chi Minh to Da Nang. Although I had trouble locating the right check-in counter, the rest of the airport was a breeze to get through. I had Com tam suon nuong again for lunch inside the airport. Definitely one of the better airport meals I've had recently.

I'm surprised that these airports can still function well when all passengers are bused to their planes sitting out on the tarmac.

The flight time itself was about an hour or less. Stepping off the plane, I saw gorgeous mountains and felt the much-welcomed cooler air. After checking into my hotel, I booked it to the beach so I could check it out before the sun fell. Conveniently, my hotel is only a 5-minute walk away.

Following the delightful walk on the beach, I grabbed dinner at a place that reminded me of a slightly better Chipotle. The portions of the carne asada bowl were huge, and everything tasted great. The prices here are noticeably more expensive. I'll just have to find more local, non-touristy spots to save some money.

Tomorrow, I'm looking forward to chilling on the beach.
