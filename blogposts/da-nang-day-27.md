Morning coffee and computer work were done at the coffee shop next to the hotel. I've been opting for the Americano, but I'm tempted to try their mango coffee.

Since my Airalo eSIM ran out of data, I decided to find a Viettel store to get a new one. Viettel should provide better coverage in the North of Vietnam, like Hanoi. Moreover, this eSIM was significantly cheaper than Airalo's. I think I paid $8 for a month of data, with a 4 GB data limit each day. Insanely cheap.

For brunch, I found an American breakfast spot called Bikini Bottom. I had a delicious Grand Slam breakfast platter consisting of pancakes, scrambled eggs, a strange sausage patty, and smoky bacon. It was much better than Waffle House's Grand Slam, aside from the waffle. For my drink, I had a guava juice. I'll probably come back here, even though it was on the expensive side.

I didn't feel like planning any sightseeing today, so I just read on the beach. The beach here in Da Nang is great. I'd rank it above some of the beaches back home in South Carolina.

Dinner consisted of a peculiar mix of Grab dinners. One was a plate of roasted duck and sticky rice, which was good except for all the bones in the duck.

And then, for some reason, I thought it would be a good idea to try bun cha, which is a soup, even though I was confident it would arrive in a plastic bag as I've seen all over Southeast Asia, which it did. Luckily, the front desk had a bowl. I don't plan to eat this again soon. I didn't enjoy the fish cakes that much. Maybe I got the wrong version ðŸ¤·.
