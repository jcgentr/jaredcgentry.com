On this leap day, I had a normal morning at a new coffee shop. I tried both the salted coffee and coconut coffee. The salted coffee reminded me of the salty cheese foam found at some bubble tea shops. Essentially a dessert, the coconut coffee consisted of a sweet coconut shaved iced drink with a side of (phin?) coffee to pour over. The coffee shop had an excellent ambiance with its koi fish pond out in front of the open air seating. Vietnam sure does coffee shops well.

At a nearby restaurant, I had another banh mi for lunch. Iâ€™m still waiting to find a better banh mi than the one I ate in Phnom Penh. I wish I knew the banh mi variation that features crackling, crispy pork so I could seek it out here.

In the afternoon, I headed for The Marble Mountains. The first Marble Mountain I entered had an insanely steep climb up the cavernous marble walls. Looking down invoked quite a bit of fear as I climbed higher.

A decent view of The Marble Mountains could be seen from the top. But this view paled in comparison to the highest peak of these mountains. The view from the top was just as breathtaking as the climb up.

Well, I'm off to Hoi An tomorrow. I should be in store for another beautiful part of Vietnam, albeit a bit more touristy.
