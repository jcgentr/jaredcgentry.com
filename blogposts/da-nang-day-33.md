Happy birthday sis ðŸ¥³! Today, I traveled back to Da Nang for a night since flying to Hanoi on Monday was about $30 cheaper. I booked the night in a Da Nang hotel for $9. So cheap!

Before traveling back to Da Nang, I had a CÃ  phÃª sá»¯a and Tuna Toast sandwich (inspired by Seinfeld) at Little Hanoi Egg Coffee.

After checking into my hotel in Da Nang, I immediately headed for the beach, since this would probably be the last time to enjoy a beach here in Vietnam. I got called out by the lifeguard for swimming in a no-swim area, but I eventually found my way to the swim zone and had a good time getting rocked by the waves with the locals. Next to the swim zone, a group of men juggled a soccer ball together in a circle. They hardly ever let it touch the sand. I was impressed so much I didn't attempt to join them.

For dinner, I had an All-American meal of a cheeseburger and chili dog at Diner 66. It cost me a pretty penny (more than my hotel for the night ðŸ˜…), but I deeply enjoyed it as a nice break from the local food. I've had some heartburn lately, so I plan to cut out the sweet treats and fried foods for a while following this meal.

I'm going to miss Da Nang. I'm headed for Hanoi, the bustling capital of Vietnam, in the morning.
