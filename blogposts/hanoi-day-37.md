I started off the morning testing Eavesdrop with Mom and Dad. It seems like a single broadcasting user can have multiple listeners at the same time. That's a relief because I didn't want to implement any complex logic to track all the connections. However, the app wasn't bug free. It'll be hard to debug, but I think I need to improve the closing of the peer connections.

I went back to the Highlands Coffee on the lake and worked on the blog and booked a day trip to Ha Long Bay.

I also returned to the pho restaurant for a third time for lunch. I wasn't quite full though, so I went around the block and got a minced pork banh mi. The banh mi was great. I think I liked it so much because it had a sauce that reminded me of ranch. Oh, how I miss ranch and pizza.

Today was quite gloomy and overcast. I didn't feel motivated to look up an attraction to go checkout. I feel like I've seen most of the popular ones here in Hanoi.

I did go back to Crossfit Tay Ho at 7pm tonight. This is a very solid box. The front desk lady is so genuinely nice and friendly (and pregnant ü§∞üèª). I met some friendly Swedes doing a similar backpacking trip to me, except they're going clockwise around the Mekong region, while I'm going counter-clockwise.

For dinner, I decided to splurge and get Indian food. I ordered the mutton thali and warm cardamon milk. It wasn't the best mutton thali I've had. The dish could have provided more meat and the curries could have been served warmer. I'm just amazed by all the different, unique flavors in Indian food.

In the evening, I tried to go to a hip looking coffee shop but they were closing up as I arrived. I wish I had more time in Hanoi to try this cafe, as it seems like a really cool and hip cafe. I overheard a Japanese couple leaving as I arrived. It seems like the Japanese always appreciate and seek out nice coffee shops like myself.

Tomorrow I'm off to Ha Long Bay.
