I plan to shorten these blog posts going forward. I need to be spending more time developing my own apps if I want to have any chance of making money while traveling, or even just building a portfolio I can show to future employers.

One of my favorite parts of these days over here is visiting new coffee shops to do my morning computer work at. This morning, I found Little Hanoi Egg Coffee here in Hoi An (interesting, Hoi An and Hanoi are anagrams). I had a great lunch at this chain in Saigon. This is honestly a great chain of coffee shops from my experience so far. I had both a Vietnamese iced coffee and hot egg coffee. According to information in the shop, Cà phê sữa was created in South Vietnam since the US brought over milk products during the war, while the poorer North Vietnam invented egg coffee since that's what was available, eggs and sugar.

I worked for a good 3 or so hours there. I finally got around to deploying Eavesdrop to Fly.io. I'm making progress slowly but surely. For lunch I had a fantastic banh mi at the extremely popular Madam Khanh's, aka The Banh Mi Queen. I really enjoyed the mix of egg, pate and pork.

For the rest of the day, since I'm a bit fatigued from deciding what to do each day, I just walked around the Old Town some more, checking out all the shops. Many of the shops sell the same apparel. I wasn't sure if the Patagonia shirts were real or fake or if the size would fit, so I decided not to get one.

After attempting the Crossfit Open 24.1 with a dismal result at a nearby gym, I had dinner at the same place as last night. This time I had fried spring rolls and shrimp fried rice. Both were great, but the fried spring rolls were fantastic. They had a unique outside texture like Mini Wheats cereal.

Tomorrow, I'm headed back to Da Nang for a night before flying to Hanoi the day after.
