After a thrilling day yesterday, I decided to just relax for my last day here in Luang Prabang. I went back to Le Petit Prince Cafe for my morning work and brunch. I had a huge fruit platter, some coffees, and a Korean curry katsu. Everything was excellent. I think mangos are one of my favorite fruits now. The curry was a perfect comfort food breakfast. I'm looking forward to the curry katsu in Japan now.

Feeling weak, I decided to rent the motorbike again and drive out to a local gym called Mr Big Muscle Gym ðŸ˜†. The day pass was dirt cheap. Another white guy and I were the only foreigners in the gym. It was well-stocked with equipment, but it was a hot box. My shirt was glued to my body by the end of the workout. I'm looking forward to getting back to Crossfit in Chiang Mai.

For dinner, I finally tried pork laab, the national dish of Lao. I really enjoyed this dish. The ground pork was nice and fatty. The dish had a strong lime taste. The crunchy onions on top were a nice addition.

After dinner, I had two desserts. The first was Nam Wan, which is a sweetened coconut milk drink with various toppings. I liked all the jellies and jackfruit I got with it. This is a solid dessert, especially on hot evenings. The second dessert was a chocolate cinnamon roll at a cafe where I knocked out yesterday's blog post. I have to say it looked better than it tasted. I'm sure if it was warm it would have been delicious.

To finish the night, I ventured outside the downtown area on my rented motorbike and just explored some while also ripping it on some of the more deserted roads.

Tomorrow, I'm returning to Thailand and flying to Chiang Mai. I'm looking forward to it.
