This should have been my last day in Phnom Penh, but that's not the case now. I started my day as usual with my Americanos and computer work in the hostel lobby overlooking the riverside traffic. Needing to break a hundred dollar bill, I headed out to a nicer, foreigner-friendly convience store. Even this place was reluctant to break a Benjamin, but ultimately the guy did with some riel thrown in for the smaller bills. Nearby, I found an Indian restaurant and had lamb korma with rice, naan and samosas. My eyes were bigger than my stomach though as I couldn't finish the rice, naan and one of two samosas. The Indian food here is delicious, albeit some of the most expensive dishes in the city.

Running out of sites to see, I visited Wat Ounalom near the Royal Palace. It was a nice temple complex with a Buddha in front of the main entrance looking like Charles Xavier, but nothing too impressive.

In the evening, I worked out at a local gym. I was one of the two foreigners there, so I got plenty of looks my direction. This gym didn't have AC but it had enough equipment and machines to get a decent pump.

For dinner, I had what I think was Chinese Congee, or Asian rice porridge, with some fat cut of pork. Although the meat and porridge could have been warmer when served, it was tasty. I won't be seeking this out again anytime soon, though.

I ended the night watching Spurs lose to Wolves at the upstairs bar next door ðŸ˜¢.

Other notes:

What is the reverse of cat calling? Wolf whistling? I'm getting a lot of this as I walk past these "hostess" bars on the streets here in SEA. I don't mind it too much ðŸ˜….

I made a new friend at the hostel.
