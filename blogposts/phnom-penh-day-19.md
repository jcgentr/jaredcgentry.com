I had another chill day here in Phnom Penh. After my morning routine, I felt like going for a run along the riverside. Running shirtless with muscles bouncing and mullet flowing turned a few heads.

For lunch, I tried a nearby Khmer restaurant that had Morning Glory soup. The soup was slightly sweet and sour with lots of leafy greens and chunks of tender fish. It was a very clean meal, which my stomach thanked me for.

At a loss for further attractions in Phnom Penh, I checked out a bustling market. This was a very local spot and a bit overwhelming with the amount of people and tight spaces. I decided to quickly head for the National "Olympic" Stadium, after I grabbed a tasty passion fruit with cheese foam drink.

Fortunately, the indoor stadium was hosting a techno volleyball match. The venue was packed with Cambodians, and after each point, the crowd erupted in thunderous applause accompanied by a burst of techno music.

Since I couldn't find a seat, I ventured outside to the outdoor track. I paid a small fee and ended up walking a mile or so around the track barefoot.

Feeling tired of Asian food, I found a pizza place a short tuk tuk ride away. The pepperoni pizza didn't feature much pepperoni, but it was delicious nonetheless.

And of course, I finished the night with a mango smoothie. As I waited on the smoothie, a Cambodian boy sat behind me on a motorbike. His English was fantastic for a young kid. He told me he'd been learning it for only two years so far. I have a feeling this kid will go far if he keeps it up. I tried to ask him about the sweets at the adjoining food stall, but he said he couldn't translate them. I'll have to try some random ones tonight.
