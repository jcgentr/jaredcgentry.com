Oh boy, I need to walk more. These tuk tuks are too cheap and convenient. I don't have much too report from today. It was another day of chilling, while I wait for my Vietnam evisa to be approved.

Speaking of which, I caved and paid about $145 to get my application expedited. And good thing I did, because the Vietnamese travel agent informed me that my profile picture on my application would be rejected. She helped me start a new application with a proper selfie picture. The whole process was done over WhatsApp, so it felt a bit sketchy, but the travel agency has good reviews on TripAdvisor. If all goes well, I'll have my evisa by tomorrow evening and be ready to bus it to Ho Chi Minh City on Wednesday.

In the evening, I did another WOD at Crossfit Amatak. I felt a bit weak and lightheaded, so I didn't go RX on the thrusters. Afterwards, I found a Chinese Dim Sum restaurant down the street. Everything I ate was warm and delicious. I had an egg and shrimp rice roll, shumai, and egg custard buns.

Other notes:

Cambodia seems to be popular with European women. In Siem Reap and Phnom Penh, there have been many gaggles of girls speaking French, German, and British English. Maybe the Onederz hostel I'm staying at attracts more women than men. But it's more likely the temples, Killing Fields, and chill vibes here in Cambodia.
