At around 12 PM, my expedited evisa arrived in my email inbox a full 8 hours before I expected it. This was an instant mood boost, as now I can move on to Ho Chi Minh City and see some new sights.

For lunch, I tried a local noodle spot. The house noodle special contained many different cuts of meat, almost like a Vietnamese Pho dish. I noticed some sort of intestines, which tasted fatty and delicious in the sweet, nutty sauce provided with the noodles. I powered through the liver pieces. I wish I had found this spot sooner.

In the evening, I did my last WOD at Crossfit Amatak. It was a decent workout, but I still felt off and lightheaded. For dinner, I decided to treat myself to an expensive Japanese dinner. The restaurant had outdoor seating upstairs overlooking the river and riverside park. The vegetable tempura was solid even though it contained fried bell peppers. The nigiri sushi tasted better than expected given the logistics of importing most the fish in from what I understood. I also had a savory Okonomiyaki pancake for the finisher, but could only finish half of it because I was so full at this point.

At this point in the evening, I started feeling sick. My body started heating up and aching all over. It seems like I might have another case of Traveler's diarrhea or something. Fantastic.
