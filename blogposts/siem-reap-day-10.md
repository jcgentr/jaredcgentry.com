Today I traveled to Siem Reap, Cambodia. Most of my time was spent to and from the two airports. I had one final espresso at Bottomless and headed onto to DMK airport via Grab.

The drive wasn't bad, about a 45 minute ride for about $16. Since my bags were over weight, I had to check my larger backpack for about $30. Overall, the check in process wasn't too bad. The flight was a bit delayed as they had to taxi all the foreigners by bus to the plane on the tarmac. The plane trip itself was about an hour. AirAsia is a budget airline, so there wasn't anything special about this flight, but I would fly again with them.

After landing in Siem Reap, I grabbed a Grab and headed to the hostel. The airport is uncomfortably far from the city center. I believe it took 1.5 hours to reach the hostel. I quite like the hostel as the private dorms are housed in a separate wing across the street.

The vibe of Siem Reap is completely different than Bangkok. Siem Reap is a quiet, chill and easily walkable city. This stay should be a nice rest from the organized chaos that was Bangkok.

In the evening, I ventured down to the Night Market and Pub Street. There is a nice little nightlife here. Tomorrow, going to plan a tour to the main attraction here, Angkor Wat.
